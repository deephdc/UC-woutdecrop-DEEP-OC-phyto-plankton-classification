        "Provided by [VLIZ (Flanders Marine Institute)](https://www.vliz.be/nl)\n",
        "Plankton, though small, plays a critical role in marine ecosystems. Identifying plankton species is vital for understanding ecosystem health, predicting harmful algal blooms, and managing marine environments. The FlowCam, a technology capturing high-resolution images of plankton, coupled with artificial intelligence (AI), has revolutionized plankton identification. ",
        "FlowCam's ability to swiftly capture and analyze plankton images has transformed the once time-consuming process of identification. When integrated with AI, this technology can rapidly categorize and identify plankton species with remarkable accuracy, providing a comprehensive understanding of marine communities.",
        "The benefits are numerous: real-time monitoring of marine environments, early detection of changes, support for conservation efforts, and contributing valuable data for research and policy decisions. AI-driven plankton identification is a game-changer, offering a powerful tool for researchers.\n",
        "This Docker container contains a trained Convolutional Neural network optimized for phytoplankton identification using images. The architecture used is an Xception [1] network using Keras on top of Tensorflow 2.3.3.",
        "The PREDICT method expects an RGB image as input (or the URL of an RGB image) and will return a JSON with the top 5 predictions.\n",
        "As a training dataset, we have used a collection of images from VLIZ (Flanders Marine Institute) which consists of 650K images from 87 classes of phytoplankton."
